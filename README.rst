Contributing
	Contributions are welcome. Guides on developing and contributing
	are planned, in the short term opening an issue is always a safe
	choice to avoid any wasted work.

	If you want to contribute or are otherwise interested in the concepts of Brine
	but may not be fond of the underlying technologies...also feel free to open a
	ticket. All of the current choices were driven by practicality rather than
	preference or being considered the best long term solution for the problem, so
	there's still a strong chance for collaboration and convergence.
