Cucumber DSL for testing REST APIs

== Introduction

=== Motivation
REpresentational State Transfer APIs expose their functionality
through combinations of fairly coarse primitives that generally
revolve around the use of transferring data in a standard exchange
format (such as JSON) using HTTP methods and other aspects of the very
simple HTTP protocol. Tests for such an API can therefore be defined
using a domain specific language (DSL) built around those higher level
ideas rather than requiring a general purpose language (the equivalent
of scripted `curl` commands with some glue code and assertions).
This project provides such a DSL by using select libraries
integrated into Cucumber, where Cucumber provides a test-oriented
framework for DSL creation.

=== Sample Usage
The general usage pattern revolves around construction of a request
and performing assertions against the received response.

[source,gherkin]
----
When the request body is assigned:
  """
  {"first_name": "John",
   "last_name": "Smith"}
  """
And a POST is sent to `/users`
Then the value of the response status is equal to `200`
And the value of the response body is including:
  """
  {"first_name": "John",
   "last_name": "Smith"}
  """
----

=== Key Features
Variable Binding/Expansion::
In cases where dynamic data is in the response or is desired for the
request, then values can be bound to identifiers which can then be
expanded using http://mustache.github.io[Mustache] templates in your
feature files.

Type Transforms::
Different types of data can be expressed directly in the feature files
or expanded into variables by using the appropriate syntax for that
type.

Type Coercion::
Related to transforms, a facility to coerce types is also provided. This allows
more intelligent comparison of inputs which have been transformed to a 
richer data type with those that have not been transformed (normally strings).
As an example comparing a date/time value with a string will attempt to parse
the string to a date/time so that the values can be compared using the proper semantics. 

Resource Cleanup::
Tests are likely to create resources which should then be cleaned up,
restoring the pre-test state of the system: steps to facilitate this
are provided.

Authentication::
Presently OAuth2 is supported to issue authenticated requests during a
test (likely using a feature `Background`).

Request Construction and Response Assertion Step Definitions::
The previous features combined with the library of provide steps should
cover all of the functionality needed to exercise and validate all of
the functionality exposed by your REST API.

== Installation
Presently the gem for this project isn't being published anywhere:
primarily because tracking down a local gem repository seems scary. If
this project is open sourced then this will probably change but in the
meantime the project can be used off of GitHub by adding this to your
`Gemfile` and performing the usual `bundle install` dance:

[source,ruby]
----
git 'git@github.com:brightcove/brine.git', :branch => 'master' do
  gem 'brine'
end
----

Specific branches and refs can be targetted as
documented http://bundler.io/git.html[here]. This should likely be
done in any cases where you're not actively tracking Brine and don't want
your tests to suddenly break because of changes to it.

Brine can then be "mixed in" to your project (which adds assorted
modules to the `World` and loads all the step definitions and other
Cucumber magic) by adding the following to your `support/env.rb` or
other ruby file:

[source,ruby]
----
require 'brine'

World(brine_mix)
----

Select pieces can also be loaded (to be documented). With the above,
feature files should be able to be written and executed without
requiring any additional ruby code.

== Tutorial
We'll write some tests against http://myjson.com/api
(selected fairly arbitrary from the list at  https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis).
The API is being explored for the sake of this tutorial,
which also serves to bolster this library to support the effort.

=== Selecting a ROOT_URL
Brine expects steps to use relative URLs. The feature files specify
the behavior of an API (or multiple APIs), while the root of the
URLs define where that API is, so this is a natural mapping.
More practically, when developing an API it's likely to
be promoted across various environments such as
local, qa, stage, and production so having a parameterized root for
the URLs eases this while encouraging inter-environment consistency.

For simple cases where all tests are to be run against the same root,
the root url can be specified with the environment variable `ROOT_URL`,
such as `ROOT_URL=https://api.myjson.com/ cucumber`, or letting `rake`
take care of this for you such as:
[source,ruby]
----
Cucumber::Rake::Task.new do
  ENV['ROOT_URL'] = 'https://api.myjson.com/'
end
----
which could then be called with `rake cucumber`. The rake approach
can be extended for different tasks for each environment, each
of which sets the appropriate environment variables allowing the
test code itself to follow https://12factor.net/config[Twelve-Factor App guidelines]
where Rake provides sugary convenience.

=== A Basic GET
Most tests will involve some form of issuing requests and performing assertions
on the responses. Let's start with a simple version of that pattern,
testing the response status from a GET request.

[source,gherkin]
----
include::../../tutorial/missing.feature[]
----

=== A Write Request
For POST, PATCH and PUT requests you'll normally want to include a request body.
To support this, additional data can be added to the requests before they are sent
(see <<_request_construction>>).

[source,gherkin]
----
include::../../tutorial/post_status.feature[]
----

=== Test Response Properties
The API that was chosen for testing returns the link to the created resource
which is based off of a generated id. That means that the exact response cannot
be verified, but instead property based testing can be done to verify that the
data is sane and therefore likely trustworthy. In this case we
can check that the `uri` response child matches the expected pattern.

[source,gherkin]
----
include::../../tutorial/post_matching.feature[]
----

////
=== Known Response Data
One of the simplest and most obvious things to test for is that the response
contains data for which exact values are expected. Continuing from above we
can check that the response body returns the fields that we provided.

[source,gherkin]
----
include::../../tutorial/post_including.feature[]
----
////

== Environment Variables
Some Brine behavior can be tuned by passing it appropriate environment variables, listed here.

`BRINE_LOG_HTTP`::
Output HTTP traffic to stdout. Any truthy value will result in request and response
metadata being logged, a value of `DEBUG` (case insensitive) will also log the bodies.

`BRINE_LOG_BINDING`::
Log values as they are assigned to variables in Brine steps.

== Language Conventions
=== The use of ``{grave}``s
Backticks/grave accents are used as _parameter delimiters_. It is perhaps
most helpful to think of them in those explicit terms rather than thinking of them
as an alternate _quote_ construct. In particular quoting implies that the parameter
value is a string value, while the step transforms allow for alternate data types.

``{grave}``s were chosen as they are less common than
many other syntactical elements and also allow for the use of logically significant
quoting within paremeter values while hopefully avoiding the need for escape artistry
(as used for argument transforms).

== Selection and Assertion
As tests are generally concerned with performing assertions, a testing DSL should be
able to express the variety of assertions that may be needed. Because these are likely
to be numerous, it could easily lead to duplicated logic or geometric growth of code due
to the combinations of types of assertions and the means to select the inputs for the assertion.

To avoid this issue the concepts of selection and assertion are considered separate operations in Brine.
Internally this corresponds to two steps: the first assigns a selector;
the second passes the assertion to that selector which is responsible for applying the assertion against
the selected value(s). In standard step use this will still be expressed as a single step,
and dynamic step definitions are used to split the work appropriately.

For example the step:
[source,gherkin]
----
Then the value of the response body is equal to `foo`
----
Will be split where the subject of the step (`the value of the response body`)
defines the selector and the predicate of the step `is equal to {grave}foo{grave}` defines
the assertion (which is translated to a step such as `Then it is equal to {grave}foo{grave}`).

The result of this is that the assertion steps will always follow a pattern where the subject
resembles `the value of ...` and the predicate always resembles `is ...`. Learning the selection
phrases and the assertion phrases and combining them should be a more efficient and flexible way
to become familiar with the language instead of focusing on the resulting combined steps.

The chosen approach sacrifices eloquence for the sake of consistency.
The predicate will always start with `is` which can lead to awkward language such as
`is including` rather than simply `includes`.
The consistency provides additional benefits such as consistent modification:
for instance `is not` can always be use for negation rather than working out the appropriate
phrasing for a more natural sounding step (let alone the logic).

One of the secondary goals of this is that assertion step definitions should very simple to
write and modifiers (such as negation) should be provided for free to those definitions.
As assertion definitions are likely to be numerous and potentially customized, this should help optimize code economy.

=== Selection Modifiers
To pursue economical flexibility Brine steps attempt to balance step definitions which accommodate variations
while keeping the step logic and patterns fairly simple. Selection steps in particular generally accept some
parameters that affect their behavior. This allows the relatively small number of selection steps to provide
the flexibility to empower the more numerous assertion steps.

==== Traversal
Selection steps can generally target the root of the object specified (such as the response body)
or some nodes within the object if it is a non-scalar value (for instance a child of the response body).
This is indicated in the <<_selection,step reference selection steps>> by the `[$TRAVERSAL]` placeholder.
`child {grave}$EXPRESSION{grave}` or `children {grave}$EXPRESSION{grave}` can optionally be
inserted at the placeholder to select nested nodes as described in <<_traversal_2>>.

==== Negation
The selectors also currently handle negation of the associated assertions.
This is potentially counter-intuitive but as previously mentioned the intent is that this
should ease the creation of assertions. If negation is added to a selector that it is expected that
the assertion will _fail_.

Negation will be normally indicated in the <<_selection,step reference selection steps>> by the presence
of the `[not]` placeholder. A similar placeholder may be used that is more readable but leads to an equivalent
inversion of the semantics of the statement. To negate the step, the text within the ``[]``s should be inserted
in the indicated position.

[NOTE, caption='Future Versions']
Handling this in the selectors is (as mentioned) counter-intuitive and unnecessarily couples the selector
to the assertion. It is currently done for practical reasons but is likely to be replaced in a future version
after (or as part of) the initial port of the library to another platform. When it is replaced, all existing steps
will remain supported through at least one more major revision and most should (most should remain unchanged).

=== Chained Assertions
[WARNING, caption='Unsupported Feature']
Use at your own risk, this feature is *not presently supported*.

For anyone that likes to live on the (relative) edge or if this gathers notable interest...the above also
provides an implicit feature: after a value is selected multiple assertions could be performed against it.
For instance:

[source,gherkin]
----
Then the value of the response body is equal to `foo`
And it is of the type `String`
----
Though this may work in simple cases the present design is likely to produce surprising results since
some aspects (such as negation) are handled by the selector so it would be inherited by the conjunctions
even though it wouldn't read that way.

== Traversal
The language exposed by Brine is flat but the data returned by the server is likely
to include deeper data structures such as objects and collections. To allow selection within
such structures a `traversal` language is embedded within some steps which will be indicated
by the use of the `TRAVERSAL` placeholder.

The traversal language consists of a selected subset of http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/[JsonPath].

[NOTE, caption='The Selected Subset']
The subset of JsonPath functionality has been chosen that is believed to support all needed
test cases without requiring deep familiarity with JsonPath. This may lead to more numerous simple steps
in place of fewer steps that use unsupported expressions. Additionally Brine is intended to be
ported to a range of platforms and so only those steps outlined here will be supported across those platforms.
JsonPath expressions _not_ listed below will not be explicitly disallowed but are not officially supported
(will not be tested and will not be ported to another platform if needed).

=== Cardinality
Each traversal expression will select _all_ matching nodes which is therefore represented as a collection.
Often, however, only a single node is expected or desired. Therefore the traversal expression will also
be accompanied by a phrase which defines the expected cardinality, normally `child` vs. `children`. `children` will
_always_ return an array while `child` will return what would be the first element in that array. `child` should be
used when accessing a specific node within the tree, while `children` should be used for what amounts to a query
across multiple nodes (such as testing the value of a field for every element in a collection).

=== Expressions
`.$KEY`::
  Access the `KEY` named child of the starting node. The leading `.` can be
omitted if at the start of an expression.

== Step Reference
=== Request Construction
link:specs.html#_request_construction[icon:cogs[] Specification]

The requests which are sent as part of a test are constructed using
a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern[Builder].

`When a $METHOD is sent to {grave}$PATH{grave}`::
  As every request to a REST API is likely to have a significant
HTTP `METHOD` and `PATH`, this step is considered required and is therefore used
to send the built request. This should therefore be the *last* step for any
given request that is being built.

`When the request body is assigned:`::
  The multiline content provided will be assigned to the body of the request.
This will normally likely be the JSON representation of data.

`When the request query parameter {grave}$PARAMETER{grave} is assigned {grave}$VALUE{grave}`::
  Assign `VALUE` to the request query `PARAMETER`.
The value will be URL encoded and the key/value pair appended to the URL using
the appropriate `?` or `&` delimiter.
The order of the parameters in the resulting URL should be considered undefined.

`When the request header {grave}$HEADER{grave} is assigned {grave}$VALUE{grave}`::
  Assign `VALUE` to the request header `HEADER`.
Will overwrite any earlier value for the specified header, including earlier steps or defaults.

=== Assignment
`When {grave}$IDENTIFIER{grave} is assigned {grave}$VALUE{grave}`::
  Assigns `VALUE` to `IDENTIFIER`.

`When {grave}$IDENTIFIER{grave} is assigned a random string`::
  Assigns a random string (UUID) to `IDENTIFIER`.
This is particularly useful to assist with test isolation.

`When {grave}$IDENTIFIER{grave} is assigned a timestamp`::
  Assigns to `IDENTIFIER` a timestamp value representing the instant at
which the step was evaluated.

=== Selection
link:specs.html#_selection[icon:cogs[] Specification]

_see <<_selection_and_assertion>>_

`Then the value of the response status is`::
  Select the status code of the current HTTP response.

`Then the value of the response body [$TRAVERSAL] is [not]`::
  Select the value from the body of the response.

`Then the value of the response body [$TRAVERSAL] does have any element that is [not]`::
  Select any (at least one) element from the structure within the response body.

`Then the value of the response body [$TRAVERSAL] has elements which are all`::
  Select all elements from the structure within the response body.

=== Assertion
link:specs.html#_assertion[icon:cogs[] Specification]

_see <<_selection_and_assertion>>_

`Then it is equal to {grave}$VALUE{grave}`::
  Assert that the current selected value is equivalent to `VALUE`

`Then it is matching {grave}$VALUE{grave}`::
  Assert that the current select value matches the regular expression `VALUE`

`Then it is including {grave}$VALUE{grave}`::
  Assert that the current select value includes/is a superset of `VALUE`.
